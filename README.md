### How to use the precompiled version

If you want to use it without compiling anything, download the 2 zip files and extract them. Click on fflist.exe - the app will copy itself to "C:\ProgramData\RCTools\fflist.exe" and create an uninstaller "C:\ProgramData\RCTools\fflist_uninstall.cmd" - The whole process takes about 30 seconds, you won't see anything, there is no install screen. (You may need administrator rights to install the app.) After the app has been installed, you can access it via the Windows context menu (clicking on folders/drives)
